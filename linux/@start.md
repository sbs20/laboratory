# Packages
This documentation refers interchangebly between the various
linux package managers, `yum`, `apt-get` and `pacman` according
to which system I was using at the time. While bigger packages
tend to have consistent names across distros this isn't always
true... and certainly not for the smaller packages. Google will
be your friend.
