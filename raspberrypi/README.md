# Pi Recipes Readme
## Background and purpose
The purposes of this project is to distil various tasks into simple easy to follow steps.
No doubt the recipes could be automated; no doubt they appear elsewhere - I have credited
references where appropriate - but I kept forgetting and losing links and it's annoying.
So I started this project.

## Hardware and software
This is what I'm running on:
 * Raspberry Pi 2 - Model B and Raspberry Pi 3
 * Nano USB WiFi Dongle - Ralink RT5370 Chipset - driver=nl80211
 * Raspbian Stretch
