# Cases

My favourite case is the [Pibow Coupe](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pibow/products/pibow-coupe-for-raspberry-pi-3)

But I also have a [MC-RP002-BLK](http://uk.farnell.com/multicomp/mc-rp002-blk/raspberry-pi-b-pi2-enclosure-black/dp/2426745)
which let's you mount the pi camera internally. I managed to lose the screws
for the camera mounting though. Eventually, after some experimentation I found
some replacement screws which are
[M2 3mm](https://www.accu.co.uk/en/pozi-pan-head-screws/9239-SPP-M2-3-A2).
