# Laboratory

Since starting with a single Raspberry Pi about 18 months ago and
tinkering with a DNS and DHCP server I've gradually added more
hardware as I've looked into and researched networks, flavours of
linux, firewalls, switches, IoT, virtualisation and so on. I had
begun to build up more and more repos of my documents which
overlapped more and more.

This is the merged repo for all the flavours of linux, networking,
firewalls, virtualisation and anything else that comes up.

  * [Linux](linux/@start.md)
  * [Virtualisation](virtualisation/readme.md)
  * [Raspberry Pi](raspberrypi/README.md)
  * [QNAP NAS](qnap/README.md)
