## Background and purpose
The purposes of this project is to distil various tasks into simple easy to follow steps.
No doubt the recipes could be automated; no doubt they appear elsewhere - I have credited
references where appropriate - but I keep forgetting and losing links and it's annoying.
So I started this project.

## Hardware and software
This is what I'm running on:
 * QNAP 639-Pro
 * QTS 4.2

## Recipes
1. [The basics](basics.md)
2. [DHCP / DNS server](dns-server.md)
3. [Autostart](autostart.md)
4. [SANE Scanner Server](sane-scanner.md)
5. [Unmount share](unmount-share.md)
6. [Corrupt files / rsync errors](corrupt-files.md)

## Licensing
I'm not completely sure there's anything all that worthy of note here - but for the avoidance
of doubt I consider this project to be released under the MIT license - do whatever you like.
Having said that, if you notice errors or things change or you want to help then it would be
great if you could contribute or propose changes. Also, if you do reference this, then it would
be nice if you gave credit where it's due; but nothing bad will happen if you don't - except
perhaps a gnawing and all-consuming guilt.
