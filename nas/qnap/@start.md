# The basics
For any of the recipes here make sure you have at least followed these steps

## Connect via SSH
1. Enable SSH server
2. Install putty and connect (use your admin account)

## Install Entware (Optware is no longer supported).

    or download the install for [x86](http://qnapware.zyxmon.org/binaries-x86/installer/Qnapware_0.90_x86.qpkg)
    or [ARM](http://qnapware.zyxmon.org/binaries-arm/installer/Qnapware_0.90_arm-x19.qpkg).
 * Login to your NAS, load App Center and choose "Install manually".

### Check and update Entware
(You may need to restart your current shell in order to pick up the new $PATH)
```
opkg -version
opkg update
```

## Install nano
```
opkg install nano
```

## Consider installing Optware anyway
Optware is no longer supported - but it might still be better for you. Have a
look [here](http://forum.qnap.com/viewtopic.php?t=111389) for more detail or
just download the [package](http://download.qnap.com/QPKG/Optware_0.99.163.zip)
and install it manually.
